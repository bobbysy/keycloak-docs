## Build the site and make it available on a local server.
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Rebuild your Jekyll site when a file changes with the --watch switch

### Install
```sh
gem install jekyll-watch
```

### Usage
Pass the --watch flag to jekyll build or jekyll serve:

```sh
jekyll build --watch
jekyll serve --watch # this flag is the default, so no need to specify it here for the 'serve' command
```

## Browse to http://localhost:4000

## bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init
```sh
bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init
```

## Offline support

1. On your development machine, cache the gems required by your applications into vendor/cache directory:

```sh
bundle package --all --all-platforms
```

This will package all required gems into *vendor/cache* folder, for all platforms (that ensures that using different platforms for development and deployment wonâ€™t be an issue).

Remember to run that command any time you update dependencies.

2. Make sure vendor/cache is checked into source control so that the offline machine can use it to install the gems.

3. Once deployed to the node without internet, run
```sh
bundle install --local
```
